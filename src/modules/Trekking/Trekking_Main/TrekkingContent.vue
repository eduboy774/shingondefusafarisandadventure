              Located in Tanzania, East Africa, Mt. Kilimanjaro is the highest
              free-standing mountain in the world and one of the Seven Summits
              prized by climbers. It stands 19,341 feet tall (5,895 meters), and
              has 3 volcanic cones as peaks: Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. Kibo is
              the highest peak followed by Mawenzi at 16,983 feet (5,149 meters)
              and then Shira at 13,000 feet (3,962 meters). Both Mawenzi and
              Shira are extinct volcanoes. Kibo is dormant (meaning it could
              erupt again), but the last major eruption took place between
              150,000 and 200,000 years ago. The best months to climb Mt.
              Kilimanjaro are June, July, August, September, which offer the
              clearest and warmest conditions.

              This is a multi-day trek to significant altitude, led by

              mountain peak. Tough, but truly rewarding, this challenge will
              leave you with memories to last a lifetime.
