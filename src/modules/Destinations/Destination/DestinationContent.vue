              Like its neighbor to the north, Tanzania is a super safari
              destination, and a popular choice due to its pristine
              environments, healthy wildlife populations, and strictly imposed
              limitations on visitor numbers. Perhaps the best well-known park
              in Tanzania is the Serengeti, and rightly so. An immense Tanzania
              Destinations covering nearly 6,000 square miles, the Serengeti is
              the theatre of the most recognized mass movement on earth â the
              great wildebeest migration. 1.5 million wildebeest are accompanied
              by 250,000 zebra as they move through this vast ecosystem, with
              countless predators in tow.

              In addition to the Serengeti and all that it has to offer, we must
              forget Tanzania other gems: Mount Kilimanjaro is iconic and well
              worth a visit. Most arrivals into Northern Tanzania land at
              Kilimanjaro International Airport so you appreciate the scale of
              the highest freestanding mountain in the world before you even
              step foot on terra firm. The wonderfully bustling town of Arusha
              is safe, friendly and fascinating and a good base for most trips.

            <p class="text-justify">
              Lake Manyara National Park, a couple of hours south of Arusha, is
              wonderfully diverse, home to exotic flora almost jungle-like â as
              well as a host of unique fauna. Flamingos are regulars in this
              part of the world, calling the large saline lake home during the
              wet season, along with plenty of lions, leopards, elephants,
              hippos, gazelle, and impala. Finally, the Ngorongoro Crater is
              another of the worlds most recognizable sights. This enormous
              caldera, 20km wide, is home to resident wildlife some of which
              never leaves, providing year-round game viewing.

              A few km down to the west of the Ngorongoro Crater lies Olduvai
              Gorge, considered the seat of humanity after the discovery of the
              earliest known hominids in the 1950s.
